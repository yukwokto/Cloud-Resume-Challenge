# Cloud-Resume-Challenge

Welcome to my cloud resume challenge repository. This is my first project developed using the aws platform. 

I hosted a static resume website on S3.

Website URL: https://yukwokto-resume.com/

In this project, major AWS services utitilised are:

-AWS S3

-AWS CloudFront

-AWS Route 53

-AWS IAM

-AWS Certificate Manager

-AWS Lambda

-AWS API-gateway

-AWS DynamoDB

Beyond AWS, I also experiment with Infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform. I successfully construct the template for the backend component of my website. 
Check out the terraform folder, and you will be able to find out the code for the cloud infrastructure. 

Improvement: If I have more time, I would develop my CI/CI pipeline for further automation. If you have any good suggestion, feel free to reach me out!
